**Key Inputs:**  
From City | Destination | Destination Type | Trip Duration | Budget  

**Outputs:**  
Top 5 similar packages with details like cost, duration, accommodation, and type.

## 📊 Data Collection

**Dataset:** Open-source travel dataset with **22,342 records** and **11 features**  

**Features:**  
`Package_ID`, `From_City`, `Destination`, `Destination_Type`, `Trip_Duration_Days`, `Budget`,  
`Accommodation_Type`, `Transport_Mode`, `Activities_Count`, `Season`, `Package_Type`

**Objective:**  
Prepare structured, high-quality data for an ML-based recommender system.

---

## 🧹 Data Validation & Cleaning

✔ Checked column data types and unique values  
✔ Removed duplicates and special characters  
✔ Standardized categorical text (lowercase)  
✔ Verified numeric ranges (duration, budget)  
✔ Handled outliers in **Budget** using percentile capping (5th–95th)

**Outcome:**  
A clean, validated dataset ready for analysis and modeling.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Univariate Analysis**

- Numeric: `Budget`, `Trip_Duration_Days`, `Activities_Count`  
- Categorical: `Destination_Type`, `Package_Type`, `Season`

**Bivariate Analysis**

- `Trip_Duration_Days vs Budget` → Longer trips → higher cost  
- `Destination_Type vs Season` → Beaches popular in winter, hills in summer  
- `Budget vs Package_Type` → Luxury > Premium > Standard  

Visualizations created using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**.

## 💡 Key Insights

🌴 **Most Popular Destinations:** Goa, Delhi, Jaipur  
💰 **Average Trip Cost:** ₹ 49 K  
🕒 **Common Duration:** 4–6 days  
❄️ **Highest Bookings:** Winter Season  
🏨 **High Spenders:** Luxury Packages  

---

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard

Interactive dashboard built to visualize insights such as:

- Destination popularity

## 🧠 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

- **Categorical Encoding:** OneHotEncoder  
- **Numeric Scaling:** MinMaxScaler  
- **Feature Selection:**  
  `Destination_Type`, `Trip_Duration_Days`, `Budget`, `Accommodation_Type`, `Transport_Mode`, `Season`, `Package_Type`
- **Weight Assignment:**  
  `Destination_Type (0.4)`, `Budget (0.25)`, `Duration (0.2)`, others (0.15)`

## 🤖 Model Development – Cosine Similarity

**Algorithm:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with Cosine Similarity  

**Process:**

1️⃣ Convert user input → feature vector  
2️⃣ Compute cosine similarity with all records  
3️⃣ Retrieve Top 5 packages with highest similarity  
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import pandas as pd
def recommend_packages(from_city, destination, destination_type, duration, budget, top_n=5):
user_df = pd.DataFrame({
        'From_City': [from_city],
        'Destination': [destination],
        'Destination_Type': [destination_type],
        'Trip_Duration_Days': [duration],
        'Budget': [budget]
    })
    # preprocess → encode → scale → compute similarity
    similarity = cosine_similarity(user_vector, dataset_vectors)
    top_indices = similarity[0].argsort()[-top_n:][::-1]
    return df.iloc[top_indices][['Destination','Package_Type','Budget','Trip_Duration_Days']]
```
## ⚙️ Real-Time Implementation

Deployed via **Streamlit**, allowing users to:

1️⃣ Select preferences (**From City**, **Destination**, **Type**, **Duration**, **Budget**)  
2️⃣ Get **Top 5 Recommended Packages** with Similarity Scores  
3️⃣ View details like **Accommodation**, **Season**, **Transport Mode**

## 🧭 Full Stack (Frontend + Backend)

## 📌 Overview

The **Travel Package Recommendation System** is a full-stack web application designed to provide **personalized travel package recommendations** based on user-selected preferences such as **departure city, destination city, budget, duration and destination type**.  

The frontend is built using **React (Vite)** for a fast, responsive, and modular interface, while the backend uses **Flask** to fetch the top 5 recommended travel packages generated by the Machine Learning model developed by the Data Science team.  

Deployment is handled using **Vercel (for frontend)** and **Render (for backend)** for seamless cloud hosting and public accessibility.

---

## 🔄 Backend API (Flask)

The Flask backend exposes endpoints for:
- `/recommend` – Returns top 5 travel packages based on user’s selected destination and type.  
- Communicates with the ML model built using **KNN (Cosine Similarity)** by the Data Science team.

---

## ⚙️ Deployment

- **Frontend** → Hosted on **Vercel**  
  - Runs React (Vite) app for users.  
  - Fetches recommendation data from the Flask backend API hosted on Render.

- **Backend** → Hosted on **Render**  
  - Flask server runs the ML recommendation logic.  
  - Exposes REST API endpoints consumed by the frontend.

---

## 🧠 How It Works (End-to-End)

1️⃣ User selects **departure city**, **destination**, **Bufget**, **Duration** and **destination type** from the frontend.  
2️⃣ These details are sent to the Flask backend via API request.  
3️⃣ Backend applies **KNN (Cosine Similarity)** model to find the most relevant 5 packages.  
4️⃣ The frontend displays these recommendations dynamically.  
5️⃣ Users can mark favorites, view details of destinations.  

---

## 🧩 Environment Setup

### 🔹 Frontend (.env)


### 🔹 Backend (Render)
- Add your model and dataset to Flask.
- Ensure CORS is enabled to communicate with frontend hosted on Vercel.

### 🧱 Frontend (Vite React)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
